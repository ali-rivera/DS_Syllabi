# Data Science Syllabi

This project contains a sample of introductory Data Science course syllabi and uses topic modeling to discover trends across different classes at different universities.

Many courses were identified using the [awesome-datascience-colleges repo](https://github.com/ryanswanstrom/awesome-datascience-colleges) from @ryanswanstrom.<br>
Based off of tutorials from [Blueprints for Text Analytics Using Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/blueprints-for-text/9781492074076/)
