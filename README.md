# Data Science Syllabi

This project contains a sample of introductory Data Science course syllabi and uses topic modeling to discover trends across different classes at different universities.

Many courses were identified using the [awesome-datascience-colleges repo](https://github.com/ryanswanstrom/awesome-datascience-colleges) from @ryanswanstrom.
